## Table of contents

The course covers the basics of Deep Learning, with a focus on applications.

### Lecture slides

  - [Intro to Deep Learning](https://rawgit.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/M2-IMDS/slides/01_intro_to_deep_learning/index.html)
  - [Neural Networks and Backpropagation](https://rawgit.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/M2-IMDS/slides/02_backprop/index.html)
  - [Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification](https://rawgit.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/M2-IMDS/slides/03_conv_nets/index.html)
  - [Embeddings and Natural Language Processing](https://rawgit.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/M2-IMDS/slides/04_embeddings_nlp/index.html)

Note: press "P" to display the presenter's notes that include some comments and
additional references.

### Lab and Home Assignment Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
the [github repository](https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/):

    git clone https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs

These notebooks only work with `keras and tensorflow`
Please follow the [installation\_instructions.md](
https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/blob/M2-IMDS/installation_instructions.md)
to get started.

Direct links to the rendered notebooks including solutions (to be updated): 

#### Lab 1: Neural Networks and Backpropagation

#### Lab 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

#### Lab 3: Embedding and Natual Language Processing
